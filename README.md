# An Angular-Bootstrap Test Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

## What does it do?

Well, nothing... There's only 1 page that made with tests of different bootstrap classes. There's also some kind of form at the end of page that can send data to another server that I also uploaded in dife


## Things I used

`Angular`
`Bootstrap(in CDN format)`
`MongoDB`

## How to try this project

Note: You need to download Angular CLI to your pc before

You can just download the code and on location type `npm install` to download all necessary modules and type `ng serve` to start the Angular server. After that type `localhost:4200` to your browser so you can see the website. 

Of course, to send the form data you have to activate other server first which is [here](https://github.com/NightyBlazy/Test-Server-for-Angular-Bootstrap-project)
